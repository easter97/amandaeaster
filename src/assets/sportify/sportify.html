    <h2>Sportify is a concept I am working on that allows Spotify users to generate custom workout playlists based on the type of exercise they are performing.</h2>
    <img class=project-image src="../../../assets/sportify/spotify-logo.jpg"/>
    <p>I'm someone that is deeply inspired by music and it often directly influences my mood and motivation. When it came to exercise, I found that the workout playlists generated by Spotify were either unspecific to my taste or didn't pick the right songs for the type of energy I needed.</p>

    <h3>The Idea</h3>
    <p>Research shows that the right music can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6529527/">boost workout performance</a> and even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6529527/">encourage you to exercise for longer</a>. The music that is best for your workout usually aligns with your target heart rate by matching the BPM, or beats per minute. Here's some thresholds I used for BPM by types of workouts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Yoga, pilates and low-intensity activities: <span class=number>60</span> to <span class=number>90</span> BPM </li>
        <li>CrossFit and HIIT: <span class=number>140</span> to <span class=number>180</span>-plus BPM</li>
        <li>Zumba and dance: <span class=number>130</span> to <span class=number>170</span> BPM</li>
        <li>Steady-state cardio, e.g jogging: <span class=number>120</span> to <span class=number>140</span> BPM</li>
        <li>Weightlifting: <span class=number>130</span> to <span class=number>150</span> BPM</li>
        <li>Warming up: <span class=number>100</span> to <span class=number>140</span> BPM</li>
        <li>Cooling down: <span class=number>60</span> to <span class=number>90</span> BPM</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interface & UI</h3>
    <img class=project-image src="/assets/sportify/sportify.png" />
    <p>I build the Sportify application inside of my existing Spotify Comparison app to leverage the services I already built to query the Spotify API. The Sportify interface allows users to select the type of workout they would like to build and what playlists they would like to sample from. I also provided a playlist options tab that allows users to specify the length in minutes or number of tracks they would like to have in the playlist.</p>
    <p>Right now, if you don't have enough tracks that meet the BPM criteria in your selected playlists, we just build a playlist with whatever qualifying tracks we have. I'd like to use the Spotify API to add some recommended tracks here to bulk up the generated playlist if we are under the user provided length.</p>
</div>
<div class="section math">
    <h3>The Math</h3>
    <p>For the treadmill and treadmill ladder workouts, I used a formula to determine what the target BPM should be for those types of workouts.</p>
    <h4>Formula to Calculate Steps per Minute:</h4>
    <p>You can use this formula to estimate the cadence: Cadence (SPM)<span class=number>=</span>Speed (in feet per minute) / Stride Length (in feet))</p>
    <p><span class=number>1</span> mile per hour (mph) <span class=number>=</span> <span class=number>88</span> feet per minute (fpm).</p>
        <h4>Example Calculation</h4>
        <p>Speed <span class=number>3</span> mph:</p>
        
        <p><span class=number>3</span> mph = <span class=number>264</span> feet per minute.</p>
        
        <p>Assuming an average stride length of <span class=number>2.2</span> feet:
        SPM <span class=number>= 264</span> / <span class=number>2.2 ≈ 120</span> steps per minute
        You’d want songs around <span class=number>120</span> BPM.</p>

        <p>Speed <span class=number>6</span> mph:</p>
        
        <p><span class=number>6</span> mph <span class=number>=</span> <span class=number>528</span> feet per minute.</p>
        <p>Assuming a running stride length of <span class=number>2.5</span> feet: SPM <span class=number>= 528/2.5 ≈ 211 </span>steps per minute
        
        You’d want songs closer to <span class=number>180-210</span> BPM for faster running.
        Matching BPM to Speed:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <td>Speed (mph)</td>
                <td>Approximate SPM</td>
                <td>Target BPM</td>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span class=number>3</span> mph</td>
                    <td><span class=number>~120</span> SPM	</td>
                    <td><span class=number>120</span> BPM</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span class=number>4</span> mph</td>
                    <td><span class=number>~135</span> SPM</td>
                    <td><span class=number>130-140</span> BPM</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span class=number>5</span> mph</td>
                    <td><span class=number>~150</span> SPM</td>
                    <td><span class=number>140-160</span> BPM</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span class=number>6</span> mph</td>
                    <td><span class=number>~180</span> SPM</td>
                    <td><span class=number>180</span> BPM</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>	
        <p>Playlist Strategy:
            Start with songs around <span class=number>120</span> BPM for a <span class=number>3</span> mph pace.
            Gradually increase BPM as the treadmill speed increases, matching the pace to songs with higher tempos.
            For running at <span class=number>6</span> mph, look for songs around <span class=number>180</span> BPM.</p>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, Spotify made changes to their developer API in November <span class=number>2024</span> that deprecated a lot of endpoints that made Sportify run. I had such a fun time creating this project, so I hope that Spotify will integrate these features back into its developer API to allow applications like Sportify to function again.</p>
    <p>Much like my Spotify Comparison application, a fully front-end implementation isn't quite as elegant as retrieving the data from a microservices layer, but we work with the tools we are given. If I was deploying this application on any larger scale, it would definitely benefit from a back end layer to the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h3>More to Come</h3>
    <p>My plans for the future, provided Spotify returns integral functionality back into its developer API.</p>
    <h4>Future Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Update the interface from a drag and drop list to selecting from a single list</li>
        <li>Leverage the Spotify getRecommendations endpoint to populate the playlists with tracks from a seed playlist or artist</li>
    </ul>
